+  /* On Windows, some functions use the `stdcall' calling convention,
+     in which the callee is expected to pop the arguments off the
+     stack.  Normally, the caller takes care of this, because only the
+     caller knows how many arguments it really passed.  To avoid
+     confusion, the linker symbols for `stdcall' functions have names
+     with a suffix "@N" attached to them, where "N" is the number of
+     bytes they'll pop.  That way, if a caller thinks some `stdcall'
+     function `foo' expects M argument bytes, but the definition of
+     `foo' expects N argument bytes, N != M, then the call will be a
+     reference to `foo@M', but the definition will have a linker
+     symbol `foo@N', and you'll get a link-time `symbol not found'
+     error, instead of a crash at run-time.
+
+     (Note how this fails to address calls through function pointers,
+     since the byte count isn't part of the function pointer's type.
+     Go, Microsoft!)
+
+     Whatever.  But our demangler doesn't like that '@N' suffix, so we
+     need to strip it off.  */
